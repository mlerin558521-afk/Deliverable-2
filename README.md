# Pharmacy Prescription Transaction Manager



**Short Desciption:** This project is a simple(not really)system that helps manage the pharmacy's transactions. It also allows the users to record the presciptions, process the medicine's sales and stocks, and keep track of transaction's history. The system also makes it easier for pharmacies to organize records, reduce errors, and provide faster service to customers.
